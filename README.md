# SumLists
Exercise related with Linked Lists.

## Exercise Challenge
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. 
The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the end of the list. 
Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. (You are not allowed to "cheat" and just convert the linked list to an integer).

### Solution
I used a doubly linked list in order to be able to go backwards, so I have essentially solved the first part of the question. I have done 2 index and traverse the two linked lists doing the sum (taking into account the carry, etc.) 
It's a simple algorithm, see the code for more details.
